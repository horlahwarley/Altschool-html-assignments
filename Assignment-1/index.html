        <h2>Moses Olawale Ajayi</h2>
        <p>
          Born: June 25th, 1999, Lagos, Nigeria. His journey began in the
          bustling city of Lagos, Nigeria. From an early age, Moses showed a
          keen interest in technology and gaming, a passion that would shape his
          future endeavors.

        <h2 id="second-tab">Early Life and Education</h2>
        <p>
          Growing up in Lagos, Moses attended Barth Academy for his primary
          education and Matvot College for his secondary schooling. With a
          thirst for knowledge and a knack for problem-solving, he graduated
          from Matvot College in 2017. Following his secondary education, Moses
          enrolled in the Computer Science program at Yaba College of Technology
          in 2023, a move that aligned perfectly with his interests and
          ambitions.

        <p>
          Before diving into higher education, Moses spent several years honing
          his technical skills. He learned the intricacies of iPhone hardware
          repair in Ikeja, Lagos, and provided repair services until his
          enrollment at Yaba College of Technology. This hands-on experience not
          only deepened his understanding of technology but also equipped him
          with practical skills that complemented his academic pursuits.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to his polytechnic studies, Moses joined AltSchool Africa
          in 2024 to further specialize in frontend engineering. His decision to
          join AltSchool Africa was driven by a desire to gain in-depth
          knowledge and hands-on experience in web development, an area he is
          deeply passionate about. Through this program, Moses aims to master
          the skills needed to create intuitive and engaging user interfaces,
          ultimately aspiring to become a proficient frontend developer.
